# Credit Risk Modeling

This project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the likelihood of credit default using classification algorithms.

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Perform EDA on credit dataset
- Train and evaluate models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Analyze model performance with metrics like ROC AUC, confusion matrix
- Experiment with class imbalance solutions (SMOTE, undersampling)

## ðŸ“¦ Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/credit-risk-modeling.git
cd credit-risk-modeling
pip install -r requirements.txt
